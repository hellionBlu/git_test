    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <h3>Life Of Brian (Apperantly You Haven't Seen)</h3>
    <p>Obsession has</p>
    <p>Obsession has an oder<br>
    Tunnel vision has a tell<br>
    Fanatical behavior<br>
    Seems to fit you well.</p>
    <p>Fixate on what you think you know<br>
    Your missing what you don't though<br>
    Crazy wouldn't notice<br>
    Have a lovely life in your chosen hell.</p>
    <p>Metaphores just point the way<br>
    Towards untouchable ideas<br>
    Fixating on the finger<br>
    Missed the point, dull the point as well</p>
    <p>(Dull the point. Miss the point. Dull the point. Miss the point. Dull the point. As well)</p>
    <p>Obession has an oder<br>
    Tunnel vision has a tell<br>
    It's fanatical behavior<br>
    Have a lovely life in your chosen hell.</p>
    <p>4x - Have a lovely life<br>
    In your chosen hell</p>
